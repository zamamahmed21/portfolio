                    <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
                    <p>The project aims to create a basic healthcare chatbot that allows users to ask specific healthcare-related questions. The chatbot provides responses based on predefined questions and answers to help users with general health queries.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>PySide2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: red;"> (for creating the graphical user interface)</span></li>
                        <li>Queue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: red;"> (for managing chat inputs and outputs)</span></li>
                        <li>QCompleter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: red;">(for auto-suggestion of questions)</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Users can type in healthcare-related questions and receive instant responses from a predefined set of questions and answers.</li>
    <li> Auto-suggestion feature using QCompleter for easier question input.</li>
    <li> A simple and intuitive user interface that displays the chat history clearly.</li>
    <li> Supports a dark theme for better visibility and modern aesthetics.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges:</h3>
<p>One of the primary challenges was to create a responsive user interface that efficiently handles user input and provides immediate feedback. Ensuring the application could accommodate a wide range of health-related questions without overwhelming users was also a consideration.</p>

<h3>Solution:</h3>
<p>To address these challenges, I implemented a queue system to manage user questions and responses effectively. The chat agent was designed with a set of predefined questions and answers, which ensures users receive accurate information quickly. The auto-suggestion feature enhances user experience by allowing users to see possible questions as they type.</p>

<h3>Outcome:</h3>
<p>The application successfully enables users to interact with a virtual health agent, providing quick answers to common health questions. The user-friendly interface, combined with the auto-suggestion feature, improves user engagement and satisfaction.</p>     </div>
