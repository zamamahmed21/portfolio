            <h3>Problem Statement :</h3>
            <p>

                The Salary Survey project aims to provide insights into how factors like experience, education,
                gender, and race influence employee compensation and job satisfaction across various industries and
                regions. By analyzing this data, organizations can benchmark their compensation strategies, identify
                diversity gaps, and understand the relationship between experience and salary growth. The goal is to
                help companies adopt equitable pay practices and foster a more inclusive workplace.</p>

                        values)</li>
                <li>Power BI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: red;"> (for creating the dashboard)</span></li>

                <li><strong>Male-Dominated Fields:</strong> Men significantly outnumber women in the "Computing or Tech"

                <li><strong>Geographic Limitation:</strong> Only 13 countries are represented, indicating a lack of wide

            <h3>Average Annual Salary by Job Title</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Voice Actors Lead in Earnings:</strong> Voice Actors dominate the salary spectrum, earning
                    close to 20 million—far surpassing other roles.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Earners:</strong> Other high-paying roles include Backend Systems and Overseas
                    Marketing, but their earnings are significantly less than Voice Actors.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower Average for Marketing and Translation:</strong> While jobs in Marketing, Localization,
                    and Japanese Translation are present, they earn considerably less on average.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Count of Race by Country</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>U.S. Dominance:</strong> Over 70% of survey participants are from the U.S., heavily
                    influencing the overall data.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Representation:</strong> While countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia
                    contribute meaningfully, others like France, Germany, and New Zealand represent a smaller portion of
                    the dataset.</li>
                <li><strong>Skewed Insights:</strong> This indicates that the salary data may lean toward U.S.-centric
                    results, with limited insights from other regions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Education Levels</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Highly Educated Participants:</strong> A significant 48.7% of respondents hold a Master’s
                    degree, while 31.8% have a Bachelor's degree.</li>
                <li><strong>PhDs in the Minority:</strong> Those with PhDs or professional qualifications make up a
                    smaller percentage, indicating that the survey skews towards highly educated professionals.</li>
                <li><strong>Specialized Jobs:</strong> This suggests that the roles surveyed tend to be specialized and
                    technical, correlating higher education with more advanced job positions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Average Salary by Industry</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Video Games as Top-Paying Industry:</strong> The Video Games industry boasts the highest
                    salaries, followed by Customer Service and Commercial Business, reflecting the lucrative nature of
                    these fields.</li>
                <li><strong>Diverse High-Paying Sectors:</strong> Corporate Training, Environment, and Energy also offer
                    high average salaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower-Paying Fields:</strong> Conversely, industries like Geology and Multilateral

                    16.68% of the total—consistent with its reputation as a dominant sector.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Key Sectors:</strong> Education, Nonprofits, and Government/Public Administration also
                    have a significant presence, though they don’t rank among the highest-paying sectors.</li>
                <li><strong>Broader Industry Insights:</strong> While a wide variety of industries are represented,
                    fields like Healthcare, Engineering, and Finance have fewer roles compared to Tech.</li>

                <li><strong>Geographic Representation:</strong> The data leans heavily towards U.S. and English-speaking
                    countries, with limited global diversity, especially from non-Western regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Education and Salary Correlation:</strong> The large number of individuals with advanced
                    degrees likely drives the higher salary averages seen in specialized industries.</li>
                <li><strong>Job Market Focus:</strong> Although tech dominates, there is potential for high earnings in
                    sectors like entertainment (Voice Acting, Video Games) and services (Customer Service,

            </ul>

            <h3>Average Annual Salary by Total Experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Career Peaks in Mid to Late Stages:</strong> Salaries tend to rise as individuals gain more
                    experience, peaking at around 30-40 years of experience. However, there’s a slight dip in average
                    salary for those with over 40 years of experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Earning Potential:</strong> This suggests that the highest earning potential occurs during
                    the mid-to-late career stages, but salaries might taper off in the later years.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Average Monthly Salary by Field Experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Field Expertise Drives Earnings:</strong> There’s a clear correlation between field
                    experience and monthly salary. Those with more experience in their specific fields tend to earn
                    higher monthly wages.</li>
                <li><strong>Outliers with High Earnings:</strong> Interestingly, some outliers with slightly less
                    experience still show particularly high salaries, highlighting that expertise and value can
                    sometimes outweigh years of experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Average Annual Salary by Field Experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rapid Growth Early in Career:</strong> The data shows that annual salaries rise sharply with
                    10-20 years of field experience, but begin to plateau or even dip slightly after about 30 years of
                    experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Marginal Gains for Senior Roles:</strong> Early-career professionals experience the most
                    significant salary growth as they gain field expertise, but salary increases become more marginal
                    once seniority is reached.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Count of Race by Gender</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Gender Distribution:</strong> The gender breakdown among survey participants is
                    relatively even, with men, women, and non-binary individuals each making up around 27% of the
                    population.</li>
                <li><strong>Room for Racial Diversity:</strong> While this gender balance may reflect inclusivity,
                    there’s still an opportunity for greater racial diversity in the survey’s participant pool.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Count of Country by Gender and Work Country</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Representation:</strong> The survey shows equal representation across various
                    countries, each contributing around 2.13% of the total data. While this suggests international
                    diversity, it also implies that the data may have been evenly distributed rather than reflecting the
                    actual proportions of the global workforce.</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced Gender Spread:</strong> Gender representation is consistent across different
                    countries, with men and women making up the majority of the workforce, followed by non-binary
                    individuals and others.</li>
            </ul>
